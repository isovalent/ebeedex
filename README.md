     <br />
     <br />
       Tetragon eBee is from the genus Tetragonula which is a kind of stingless bee. Tetragonula protect their hive in a collective effort, but without a stinger, Tetragon eBee took up his sword and shield. He spends his days observing the kernel and defending it from malicious actors.

       Obee-Wan Kenobee ranges across the galaxy defending colonies from moths, birds, ants, mites, mice, bears, and other malicious actors. Obee-Wan uses the Force to sense things happening in the kernel and his lightsaber for aggressive negotiations when a process gets out of line. Obee-Wan also taught Tetragon eBee everything he knows.

     <br />
     <br />
       While many bees hibernate for winter, Skiing eBee loves to go where no bee has gone before. Growing up in the verdant vallies of Diavolezza, she always wondered what the Swiss people did when she was sleeping. Curiosity eventually got the better of Skiing eBee and she awoke to find a white winter wonderland. She strapped on a pair of skis and quickly progressed from the bunny hill to double blacks and hasn't looked back since.

     <br />
       Pulses and signals are the daily lot for Electrician eBee. There's no wire, no circuit that she cannot tame. Of course, it helps when you're a creature sensitive to electromagnetic fields. Electrician eBee does her best to connect all parts of complex systems and makes it all work flawlessly. She won't hesitate to hook eBPF programs to electrical sockets if she has to. Or to report any misbehaving frequency... Wait! Could Electrician eBee be an undercover Secret Agent from the Hive?

       Security eBee is committed to ensure the well-being of all his community. He brings law, order, but also assistance and kindness to every bee in the Hive. He's often seen hard at work with his “STOP” sign, monitoring the traffic between honeycombs. Security eBee will sometimes be involved in investigations, but will defer complex cases to his friend, Detective eBee.

       Another mystery to solve? This is a job for Detective eBee! He has an eye for details, and always keeps it open. Ever since his honey jar was stolen as a child, he's been tracking (and catching!) offenders. There's no bug better at finding clues, be it on the crime scene or deep in flow logs. One day he'll have Badger O'Flake, his sworn enemy, locked up for good. Will he need his all-powerful eBPF tools for that? Elementary, my dear eBee!

       Beekeeper eBee enjoys her life! She loves going outdoors for hiking, cycling, climbing, or staying comfortably home with a book and a warm cup of tea. Alas, this leaves her little time to gather pollen. But she gets help from her cousins, smaller honeybees, of whom she loves taking care. Ensuring every worker in the hive is healthy and happy brings her joy... And honey!

Working in open source, Travel eBee has also made friends all around the world and is always up for a chance to meet them in person for a beer or some nectar. Travel eBee has been to six continents so far and is just waiting for the invite from Tux to visit the seventh.

She's super excited about the promise of <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/ebpf-for-windows">eBPF for Windows</a> and wants to help the community think about what an eBPF empowered Windows experience would look like. Having fun by playing a joke with her Excel VBA skills is also in the books.

     <br />
     <br />
       As a youngling, this eBee quickly realised he had something different from the others. It troubled him deeply as he grew up. But he held on and grew excellent at gymnastics. Attending a competition one day, he had a sudden revelation: he noticed that winners in every inter-hive competition - sports, engineering, space exploration challenges, and more - were always coming from hives or teams with the most diversity. His difference was a chance, after all! With the assistance of Jedi eBee, he turned his physical abilities towards fencing, to fight oppressors and become a champion of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion, a spark of light and hope for minorities and unique individuals. At last, DEI Force eBee became a trustful member of the Jedi... and even started to fight to reduce the inequities inside of the Order!

       What do you need a backstory for when you're resting on a hamoc under a gentle breeze, on the warm and sunny beaches of a Caribbean island? There's no place like the seashore to meet with friends and discuss new networking designs (Oh wait, I'm hearing that Skiing eBee disagrees with this statement). Caribbean eBee invites you for some fun and relaxation. Take a seat next to her. Sip your honey-rum-coconut juice. Listen to the lulling sound of the waves. Enjoy.

     <br />
       The hive is always a-buzz with activity, but not all of is always good. Audit eBee is behind the scenes checking to be sure everything is in working order - is that pollen packet going to the right address, should that bee be able to access that honeycomb, and most importantly is there enough honey for the Queen Bee. While not the most visible job, Audit eBee loves ensuring that the hive stays safe and efficient so that others can enjoy the honey of their labor.

       Another former student from Jedi eBee, Bounty Hunter eBee didn't feel like embracing the Code, and preferred to put on his robust Honeysteel armor and his full-featured pack to look for relentless action. He remains a very close friend to Tetragon eBee. What the latter does for justice, the former tends to do for credits, but they often join forces on delicate missions. Together they signal the end of the party to the most villainous processes, flood packets, or other creatures from the Outer Rim. Between two commissions, Bounty Hunter eBee loves visiting baby eBees at the orphanage where he grew up. He tells stories and helps the younglings as much as he can. This is the way!

      Infrastructure is a constant work in progress. There is always something that needs to be built, replaced, upgraded, or renewed. Luckily, Bulldozer eBee in on the job. You'll often see him out in the field digging trenches for fiber or laying the groundwork for a new Internet exchange point. Once he is finished, Electrician eBee is often right behind him to start up the real wiring. There is also a persistent rumour circulating in the hive that Bulldozer eBee occasionally digs caches to store emergency honey supplies.
