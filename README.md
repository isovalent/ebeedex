     <br />
       Tetragon eBee is from the genus Tetragonula which is a kind of stingless bee. Tetragonula protect their hive in a collective effort, but without a stinger, Tetragon eBee took up his sword and shield. He spends his days observing the kernel and defending it from malicious actors.

       Obee-Wan Kenobee ranges across the galaxy defending colonies from moths, birds, ants, mites, mice, bears, and other malicious actors. Obee-Wan uses the Force to sense things happening in the kernel and his lightsaber for aggressive negotiations when a process gets out of line. Obee-Wan also taught Tetragon eBee everything he knows.

     <br />
     <br />
       While many bees hibernate for winter, Skiing eBee loves to go where no bee has gone before. Growing up in the verdant vallies of Diavolezza, she always wondered what the Swiss people did when she was sleeping. Curiosity eventually got the better of Skiing eBee and she awoke to find a white winter wonderland. She strapped on a pair of skis and quickly progressed from the bunny hill to double blacks and hasn't looked back since.

       Pulses and signals are the daily lot for Electrician eBee. There's no wire, no circuit that she cannot tame. Of course, it helps when you're a creature sensitive to electromagnetic fields. Electrician eBee does her best to connect all parts of complex systems and makes it all work flawlessly. She won't hesitate to hook eBPF programs to electrical sockets if she has to. Or to report any misbehaving frequency... Wait! Could Electrician eBee be an undercover Secret Agent from the Hive?

     <br />
       Security eBee is committed to ensure the well-being of all his community. He brings law, order, but also assistance and kindness to every bee in the Hive. He's often seen hard at work with his “STOP” sign, monitoring the traffic between honeycombs. Security eBee will sometimes be involved in investigations, but will defer complex cases to his friend, Detective eBee.

       Another mystery to solve? This is a job for Detective eBee! He has an eye for details, and always keeps it open. Ever since his honey jar was stolen as a child, he's been tracking (and catching!) offenders. There's no bug better at finding clues, be it on the crime scene or deep in flow logs. One day he'll have Badger O'Flake, his sworn enemy, locked up for good. Will he need his all-powerful eBPF tools for that? Elementary, my dear eBee!

       Beekeeper eBee enjoys her life! She loves going outdoors for hiking, cycling, climbing, or staying comfortably home with a book and a warm cup of tea. Alas, this leaves her little time to gather pollen. But she gets help from her cousins, smaller honeybees, of whom she loves taking care. Ensuring every worker in the hive is healthy and happy brings her joy... And honey!

From documentation to tutorials and labs, Teacher eBee is always coming out with new ways to educate and entertain the hive. NewBee eBee is often close to Teacher eBee to cross pollinate some learnings, but Teacher eBee is also known to create courses where even Daniel and Alexei can learn things.

       Bees usually stick close to their hive, but after seeing all of the possibiles eBPF unlocks for the kernel, Travel eBee knew there was so much more to experience in the world. Working in open source, Travel eBee has also made friends all around the world and is always up for a chance to meet them in person for a beer or some nectar. Travel eBee has been to six continents so far and is just waiting for the invite from Tux to visit the seventh.

     <br />
     <br />
       As a youngling, this eBee quickly realised he had something different from the others. It troubled him deeply as he grew up. But he held on and grew excellent at gymnastics. Attending a competition one day, he had a sudden revelation: he noticed that winners in every inter-hive competition - sports, engineering, space exploration challenges, and more - were always coming from hives or teams with the most diversity. His difference was a chance, after all! With the assistance of Jedi eBee, he turned his physical abilities towards fencing, to fight oppressors and become a champion of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion, a spark of light and hope for minorities and unique individuals. At last, DEI Force eBee became a trustful member of the Jedi... and even started to fight to reduce the inequities inside of the Order!

       What do you need a backstory for when you're resting on a hamoc under a gentle breeze, on the warm and sunny beaches of a Caribbean island? There's no place like the seashore to meet with friends and discuss new networking designs (Oh wait, I'm hearing that Skiing eBee disagrees with this statement). Caribbean eBee invites you for some fun and relaxation. Take a seat next to her. Sip your honey-rum-coconut juice. Listen to the lulling sound of the waves. Enjoy.

       The hive is always a-buzz with activity, but not all of is always good. Audit eBee is behind the scenes checking to be sure everything is in working order - is that pollen packet going to the right address, should that bee be able to access that honeycomb, and most importantly is there enough honey for the Queen Bee. While not the most visible job, Audit eBee loves ensuring that the hive stays safe and efficient so that others can enjoy the honey of their labor.

       Another former student from Jedi eBee, Bounty Hunter eBee didn't feel like embracing the Code, and preferred to put on his robust Honeysteel armor and his full-featured pack to look for relentless action. He remains a very close friend to Tetragon eBee. What the latter does for justice, the former tends to do for credits, but they often join forces on delicate missions. Together they signal the end of the party to the most villainous processes, flood packets, or other creatures from the Outer Rim. Between two commissions, Bounty Hunter eBee loves visiting baby eBees at the orphanage where he grew up. He tells stories and helps the younglings as much as he can. This is the way!

       Caribbean eBee may already be at the beach for summer holiday, but Summer School eBee is heads down learning about the latest developments in cloud native. In such a quickly developing field as eBPF, there is never enough time to keep up with everything happening and summer school can be a great refresher. With all of the new projects, use cases, and features that Summer School eBee learns from Teacher eBee during the break, you'll be sure to see them answering a lot of NewBee's questions in the fall.

      Infrastructure is a constant work in progress. There is always something that needs to be built, replaced, upgraded, or renewed. Luckily, Bulldozer eBee is on the job. You'll often see him out in the field digging trenches for fiber or laying the groundwork for a new Internet exchange point. Once he is finished, Electrician eBee is often right behind him to start up the real wiring. There is also a persistent rumour circulating in the hive that Bulldozer eBee occasionally digs caches to store emergency honey supplies.

      With her head always in a book, Reading eBee seems to be lost in the clouds. Being distracted from the buzzing of daily life doesn't mean she isn't smart, if fact Reading eBee is a well of knowledge. From being able to quote passages from Liz Rice's latest book to knowing all of the top 20 use cases for Cilium, Reading eBee can provide information sweeter than honey. Don't give her an ebook though, she loves the sensory experience of cracking open a freshly printed book or smelling the decades of dust from books hidden away on the top shelf.

       Armed with a backpack filled with snacks and a sense of adventure, Hiking eBee is always on the lookout for peak experiences. This eBee is no stranger to challenges. They carefully navigate rocky paths, leap across babbling streams, and scale steep cliffs, always driven by an unwavering appreciation for the outdoors. Along the way, they encounter fellow creatures of the mountain, from deer grazing to inquisitive squirrels, forging connections and cherishing the natural world. As they navigate challenging paths and form bonds with the mountain's residents, they find kindred spirits among their fellow eBees, like the tech-savvy Electrician eBee, who illuminates their night hikes with electric lanterns.

They are no stranger to challenges, navigating the intricate network of honeycombs, ensuring that every nook and cranny is secure. Much like their fellow eBees, Guardian eBee draws inspiration from Detective eBee's eye for detail, Security eBee's dedication to maintaining order, and Jedi eBee's wisdom in the ways of defense and protection. As they tirelessly safeguard the hive, they find strength and camaraderie in their fellow eBees, making every day a new opportunity to protect and serve.
