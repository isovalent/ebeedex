     <br />
     <br />
       Backstory:
       While many bees hibernate for winter, Skiing eBee loves to go where no bee has gone before. Growing up in the verdant vallies of Diavolezza, she always wondered what the Swiss people did when she was sleeping. Curiosity eventually got the better of Skiing eBee and she awoke to find a white winter wonderland. She strapped on a pair of skis and quickly progressed from the bunny hill to double blacks and hasn't looked back since.

     <br />
     <br />
       Backstory:
       Pulses and signals are the daily lot for Electrician eBee. There's no wire, no circuit that she cannot tame. Of course, it helps when you're a creature sensitive to electromagnetic fields. Electrician eBee does her best to connect all parts of complex systems and makes it all work flawlessly. She won't hesitate to hook eBPF programs to electrical sockets if she has to. Or to report any misbehaving frequency... Wait! Could Electrician eBee be an undercover Secret Agent from the Hive?

       Backstory:
       Security eBee is committed to ensure the well-being of all his community. He brings law, order, but also assistance and kindness to every bee in the Hive. He's often seen hard at work with his “STOP” sign, monitoring the traffic between honeycombs. Security eBee will sometimes be involved in investigations, but will defer complex cases to his friend, Detective eBee.

       Backstory:
       Another mystery to solve? This is a job for Detective eBee! He has an eye for details, and always keeps it open. Ever since his honey jar was stolen as a child, he's been tracking (and catching!) offenders. There's no bug better at finding clues, be it on the crime scene or deep in flow logs. One day he'll have Badger O'Flake, his sworn enemy, locked up for good. Will he need his all-powerful eBPF tools for that? Elementary, my dear eBee!

       Backstory:
       Beekeeper eBee enjoys her life! She loves going outdoors for hiking, cycling, climbing, or staying comfortably home with a book and a warm cup of tea. Alas, this leaves her little time to gather pollen. But she gets help from her cousins, smaller honeybees, of whom she loves taking care. Ensuring every worker in the hive is healthy and happy brings her joy... And honey!
